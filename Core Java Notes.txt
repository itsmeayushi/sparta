					What and Why Java?

		Java is an Object Oriented Language.
		object oreinted,multithreading,platform independent,robust

		Object Oriented features: Abstraction, Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism

		is java a pure object oriented language??
		NO, bcoz java still supports primitive types like int,char,float.

		Student student=new Student();
		Student student: reference variable : stack memory
		new Student();: object : heap memory
		int num=10;


		Why Object Oriented Approach??
		it is based on real world. 

		mobile phone
		abstraction(showing relevant data/info) : behaviour(functions) : "What to do?"
		encapsulation(hiding complex details): attributes/implementation: "How to do?"
		Inheritance(resuability)
		Polymorphism( many forms)

		Various types available in Java
		1. primitive types(int,char,float,double,byte....)
		2. Derived types( arrays)
		3. User defined types( classes,enums,interfaces..)

		What is class?
		A class is a user defined type which exhibits attributes and behaviour.

		What is object?
		An object is an instance of a class.


		class Mobile{
			
			private chips,circuits

			public call
			public message
	
		}

		object: abstraction

			    JRE: JVM(Java Virtual Machine)+ Library(classes,interface)


Variables in class:
Instance variables: these variable are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is deallocated from the memory.
Class/static  variables: these variables are created when the class is loaded in the memory, and gets destroyed when the class is unloaded or the program is stopped.

Static block:
A static block is used to initialize static variables. 
A static block called even before main method during the class is being loaded.
A static block is called only once for a class whereas constructor are called everytime an object is created.


arrays: are set of similar type variables. It allocate consecutive memory. is a way of collecting data.
        an array is a fixed size variable.

	int[] phonenumbers=new int[3];
	
	int[] phonenumbers;

	phonenumbers=new int[3];

Method overloading:
In a class, we can have more than one method with the same but different method signature.
Method signature:
1. Number of parameters
2. Type of parameters
3. Sequence of parameters

public void add(int a,int b){}
public void add(float a,float b){}
public void add(float a,float b,float c){}
public void add(int a,float b){}
public void add(float a,int b){}


class System{

   static PrintWriter out;

}

class PrintWriter{

	println(String[] ){
		
	}
}
System.out.println()

Generics are used to write type-safe code.
